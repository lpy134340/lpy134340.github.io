# Peiying Li

Data Analyst and Engineer 

Driven by curiosity and a detail-oriented approach, I transform challenges into opportunities by uncovering key insights, building scalable solutions and presenting actionable strategies to stakeholders.

Beyond the code, I find joy in connecting with communities. You may find me brainstorming the next innovative ideas at local artisan bakeries. As a former President of a Women in Tech organization, I actively contribute to initiatives like Women in Data Science, championing inclusivity and innovation.
